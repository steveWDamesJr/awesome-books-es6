# Axe: Color (`color`)

`axe/color` contains accessibility rules
from the axe color category.

See the ["Can the hint be configured?"][can configure] section of
`hint-axe` for examples of enabling, disabling, and changing the
severity of individual rules.

## Default rules (WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA)

* [Elements must have sufficient color contrast][color-contrast] (color-contrast)

## Additional rules (off by default)

* [Links must be distinguished from surrounding text in a way that does not rely on color][link-in-text-block] (link-in-text-block)
