# webhint (`hint`)

## Quick start user guide

If you want to have an idea of what `webhint` does and you
have an updated version of `npm` (v5.2.0) and [Node.js LTS (v8.9.2)
or later, x64 version recommended](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
you can use the following command:

```bash
npx hint https://example.com
```

The recommended way of running webhint is as a `devDependency` of
your project.

```bash
npm install hint --save-dev
```

And then add a script task to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "webhint": "hint http://localhost:8080"
    }
}
```

And run it via:

```bash
npm run webhint
```

You can also run webhint from within [VS Code][] and as a
[browser extension][].

**NOTE**: If you run into any issues during the install process
please check the [troubleshoot section](https://github.com/webhintio/hint/blob/HEAD/packages/hint/docs/user-guide/troubleshoot/summary.md).
