# Ignoring domains

Sometimes you donâ€™t have control over all the infrastructure and there
is nothing you can do about it. Reporting errors in those cases generates
noise and frustration. Instead of globally disabling a hint you might
want to turn it off for a domain, or directly ignore completely one (like
a third party analytics, ads, etc.). To achieve this you need to add the
`ignoredUrls` property to your `.hintrc` file:

```json
"ignoredUrls": [{
    "domain": ".*\\.domain1\\.com/.*",
    "hints": ["*"]
}, {
    "domain": "www.domain2.net",
    "hints": ["disallowed-headers"]
}]
```

Properties can be:

* regular expressions, like `.*\\.domain1\\.com/.*`. This will match:
  * `something.domain1.com/index.html`
  * `somethingelse.domain1.com/image.png`
* some text, like `www.domain2.net`. In this case, if the resource URL
  contains the text, it will be a match. E.g.:
  * `www.domain2.net/index.php`
  * `www.domain2.net/image.png`

The value of the property has to be an array of strings where the
strings can be:

* `*` if you want to ignore all hints for the given domain.
* The ID of the hint to be ignored.

In the previous example we will:

* Ignore all hints for any resource that matches the regex
  `.*\\.domain1\\.com/.*`.
* Ignore the hint `disallowed-headers` for the domain `www.domain2.net`.

Some hints also have a default ignore list to avoid false positives in
certain contexts (e.g. cache headers when developing on localhost).
These default values can be overriden by specifying your own ignore
list for those specific hints.
